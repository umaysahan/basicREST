I chose back-end because I want to be a back-end developer. I know React, which is a front-end library, but my career goal is mostly backend-oriented.
If I was working on a project project would contain CRUD operations for the user. I would  SOLID and OOP principles
I would document for a developer
I would handle exceptions for resilient web service
I would return valid status codes for responses
Each service would have a valid JSON response
Test Driven Development would a good choice
I would dockerize the project.
